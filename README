# Lisp classes implementation

The objective of this project was to implement classes in lisp without using any of the current class system neither the structs.

More is explain at the [project description](https://github.com/Gisson/PA2_CLOS/blob/master/description.pdf)

A very summarized explanation of our implementation can be found at the [presentation slides](https://github.com/Gisson/PA2_CLOS/blob/master/info/p2.pdf).

## How to run

In the folder scripts you can find a script that zips but first runs the program and tests it against a test battery handed to us by the teacher.

To run it yourself there is a Makefile so you just need to do ```make run```. The default target is test.
*Make sure you have clisp installed*
